# Project 1 Summary

Project 1 implements core optimization methods for two objective functions:
- Pi_a(x) = x^2
- Pi_b(x) = (x + (pi/2) * sin(x))^2

Deliverables:
- Objective plots, gradients, and Hessians
- Newton convergence runs for multiple initial guesses
- Standard GA results for Pi_a and Pi_b
- Phi/Psi GA results for Pi_a and Pi_b

This project is complete and polished. Outputs are stored under projects/project1/output/.
